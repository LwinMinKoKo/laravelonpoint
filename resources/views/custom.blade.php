  <h1>Temperature Monitoring</h1>
  <p>
For any building one of the key built environment measurements is ‘temperature’. Most of us can relate to this when we think about our heating systems and the thermostatic control unit, we used to control these. Thermostats are generally pre-programmed to set our heating ON/OFF at pre-set times, with a manual override to accommodate weather related temperature changes.

Within a server room or datacentre environment it is of course the cooling system that dominates the ambient environment. As with a heating system, the cooling solution installed is thermostatically controlled with a manual override facility. What differs is the dramatic effect that a cooling failure can make to the operation of critical IT servers and networking devices.

Most server racks run between 2-5kW of IT devices. Some high-density solutions can see power requirements far higher from 15-30kW at the top-end. Within an IT environment, power in kW equates to heat output that requires constant cooling to maintain an ideal temperature range of 18-25°C.

One issue for most installations is that the temperature varies with both their server rooms and server racks. The rear exhaust channel behind a server rack will have a higher ambient temperature than the front of the rack, which is usually presented with a cool and air-conditioned airflow. Within a server rack, temperatures can also vary due with hot-spots due to poor equipment layout and an inefficient air flow. Blanking plates, panels and sealing tapes can help to improve airflow efficiency but there will almost always be temperature differences between the bottom, middle and top of the cabinet as well as the front and rear channels.

If the room suffers an air conditioner failure, either complete or partial (N+X system), the overall ambient temperature could rise rapidly. Within a server rack, the temperature rise could be dramatic and create a potential fire risk if the IT systems are not powered down. The higher the kW power draw within the server rack, the higher the risk of fire.
